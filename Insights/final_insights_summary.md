1. Monthly Sales Analysis

This insight focuses on first-quarter sales performance in 1997 and 1998. Due to the Northwind dataset spanning from July 1996 to May 1998, a full competitive year-on-year analysis is not feasible. Therefore, this comparison is narrowed to the first three months of both years to ensure a fair and focused comparison.

Given the limited data and the relatively small scale of Northwind’s operations, focusing on shorter, more comparable periods yields more actionable insights.

Revenue Growth: Between Q1 1997 and Q1 1998, total revenue increased by 115.8%, rising from 138.29K to 298.49K.

Monthly Breakdown:

March showed the highest year-over-year increase: +172.01%

January had the smallest growth: +53.81%

This sharp increase suggests solid year-on-year growth, likely driven by stronger product performance and customer retention.

2. Top 10 Best-Selling Products

This analysis identifies the highest-grossing products by total revenue.

Top 3 Products:

Côte de Blaye (Beverages) – 141.40K

Thüringer Rostbratwurst (Meat/Poultry) – 80K

Raclette Courdavault (Dairy Products) – 71K

Impact: These 10 products contribute 44.16% of the total revenue (~1.27M), emphasizing the importance of optimizing inventory and promotion around these key items.

3. Category-Level Sales Overview

A full-category breakdown by total revenue offers strategic insights into demand by product type.

Top Categories:

Beverages: 268K (21.16%)

Dairy Products: 235K (18.51%)

Confections: 167K (13.15%)

Least Revenue Category:

Grains/Cereals: 96K (7.56%)

Notable Insight: Côte de Blaye, the top-selling product, is also the most expensive item in the catalog (unit price: 263.50), suggesting that price is not a barrier when product value is perceived to be high. Beverages also lead in units sold (404 units), reflecting consistent demand volume across SKUs.

4. Employee Performance Analysis

This analysis evaluates individual employee performance based on monthly revenue contributions and experience.

Top Performer:

Margaret: 3.9K average monthly revenue (18.39% contribution), 60 months experience

Bottom 3 Performers:

Anne (1.8K), Michael (1.3K), Steven (1.3K)

Observation:

Anne, with the least experience (42 months), may be under development and should not be heavily scrutinized yet.

Michael and Steven, with 55 months of experience each, underperform relative to similarly tenured colleagues like Robert (52 months) and Laura (50 months).

Targeted support or performance improvement plans may be warranted for mid-tenure underperformers.

5. Shipper Performance Analysis

Customer satisfaction, especially regarding delivery timelines, is critical for reseller loyalty and order consistency.

On-Time Delivery Rate: 91.22% (843 orders)

Shipper Breakdown:

Federal Shipping: 96.39% on-time (249 orders)

Speedy Express: 95.10% on-time (245 orders)

United Package: 94.92% on-time (315 orders)

Insight: While shipment speed per order is less relevant due to predefined required delivery dates, meeting those deadlines is essential. All three partners maintain strong performance, with Federal Shipping showing a slight edge.

6. Customer Demographics and Revenue Segmentation

Customers were segmented into three equal-sized tiers based on their revenue contributions.

Low Tier (Bottom 33%):

Revenue: 63.53K → 5.02% of total revenue

Mid Tier (Middle 33%):

Revenue: 239.41K → 18.91% of total revenue

High Tier (Top 33%):

Revenue: 962.86K → 76.07% of total revenue

Insight: The revenue is highly skewed toward a small subset of top customers. This indicates a mix of small-scale and large-scale resellers. Further customer acquisition and profiling would help in identifying stable patterns for customer lifetime value (CLV).

Conclusion:
This analysis revealed actionable insights across sales trends, product performance, employee contribution, logistics efficiency, and customer distribution. Northwind demonstrates solid growth and potential in its sales, but opportunities exist in employee training, deeper customer segmentation, and product-level promotion strategies. With clearer data structure and focused decision-making, the company can scale these successes sustainably.
