This report was developed using a local SQL Server instance (eren\monster) and the NORTHWINDDB database for demonstration purposes.

The file is safe to open. The source has been anonymized where possible.

If you wish to refresh the data, you can either:
• Replace the server reference in Power Query with your own SQL Server instance
• Or create a local SQL Server named eren\monster and restore the NORTHWINDDB database
• Database restore file is located under Database folder. You can download the .bak file and restore the database on your server management studio.
